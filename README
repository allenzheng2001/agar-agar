eCIS submitted!

- Source code located in *.js files in /src/. They are described in the writeup, page 2 (REPORT.pdf)
    - /src/assets/ contains the textures for the Frame biomes.
- Demo code located in /test/. More details below.
- milestones.txt was my personal memo for tracking features/progression, but it contains more thorough descriptions of the features and demo milestones. Again, more details below and in that file itself.

**HOW TO RUN/PLAY** 
The html file uses an online source to link the p5.js Library, so make sure you have an internet connection!

How to run:

With npm:
    cd src
    npm install http-server -g
    http-server -c-1

With python (slower)
    cd src
    python3 -m http.server

With VSCode Live Server Extension:
    open src/index.html on VSCode
    Click "Go Live" on the bottom

How to Play:
- Open the simple web server that hosts the game.
- Move your mouse around to make the blob "follow you"
- Try to get as big as possible by eating (colliding with) other blobs smaller than you
- Avoid death by larger players eating you, entering black holes, or lava, or you will meet the GAME OVER screen.

Controls:
- p: Pause the game
- s: (for demo purposes) stop the player
- hold f: "fast mode": your blob(s) travel at a faster speed, but shrink in size
- hold a: "safe mode": your blob(s) shrink but cause other blobs to bounce off them
    - these two modes can only be used if you are larger than the initial spawn radius!
- space bar: "split": your blob(s) each binary-split on an axis orthogonal to the mouse.
    - only blobs with large enough radii to split will be
- 1: cheats: a window is printed on the screen showing the location and sizes of other NPCs, along with your location and current Biome.
- r: reset to an entirely new world
- shift+r (after game over): respawn in the same world

For Demo/Debug Purposes:
- "k": all capable npcs split
- hold ';': all capable npcs go into fast mode
- hold 'l': all capable npcs go into safe mode

To Toggle Game Settings:
- see fields.js, update the fields that you want to (e.g. allow NPCs to extend), refresh the page

For a more "complete" list of features (and description of demos), please see 'milestones.txt.' It is the document where I tracked my progress and set further goals as I went along.

**RECREATING DEMOS**:
I plan on presenting my features in the same order I created them, so the demos I use are earlier versions of this project. They are isolated in their own folders in the /test/ directory. As stated above, you can see the descriptions of all of their features in 'milestones.txt.' Features of the current implementation are inclusive of those above it, of course.

You actually don't need a server to run most of them (all except test/test6-1 and src/):

Simply copy and paste the absolute path to its .html in your web browser and it should work!

Example of the path: /home/allen/projects/cs378h/agar-agar/test/test1/test1.html

For test 6-1, same as src:

With npm:
    cd test/test6-1
    npm install http-server -g
    http-server -c-1

With python (slower)
    cd test/test6-1
    python3 -m http.server

With VSCode Live Server Extension:
    open test/test6-1/index.html on VSCode
    Click "Go Live" on the bottom
