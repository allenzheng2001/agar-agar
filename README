Current implementation:
(test1)
- player follows mouse
- food particles can be eaten
- smooth lerp to grow size 
- colors

- expanding window size
- pause functionality (press s)
- auto-generation skeleton code

TODO (subject to change):
- generate and expand map "frames" instead of auto-expanding rectangle
- port over food spawning: auto-generate foods ? (test2)
- spawn one food elsewhere per one that gets eaten
- binary fission, then converge (test3)
- add NPCs? (test4)
- add course hazards (auto-generating?)
    - breaker
    - mirror
    - black hole / E&M field (changes velocity O_O)
    - negative foods?
- add biomes (refactory)?
- QoL: increase speed, safe mode. both decrease radius

FUTURE DIRECTIONS (after turn in)
- networking for multiplayer
- 3D?
