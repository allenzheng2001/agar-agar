Current implementation:
(test1)
- player follows mouse
- food particles can be eaten
- smooth lerp to grow size 
- colors

(test2)
- expanding window size
- pause functionality (press p)
- auto-generation skeleton code
- generate and expand map "frames" instead of auto-expanding rectangle
- port over food spawning: auto-generate foods
- spawn one food elsewhere in the world per one that gets eaten
- speed up and shrink (hold f)

(test3)
- Player object that supports multiple blobs: around a center of mass.
- Binary Fission (space key): Split on an axis perpendicular to mouse vector (vel'koz q)
    - blobs can only split at a certain size (s.t. splitted blobs aren't smaller than initial)
    - split speed scales with size of the splitted blob
    - can only have a max number of children (8)
- multiple blobs: lerp to our center of mass -- it's constantly changing!
- convergence: vector from each blob to the mouse, scaled according to cosine to follow the CoM (not go off window)
    - converges after a time expiration, which increases based on total size for fairness
        - could be more smooth
        - fixed sec(x) oob
- reset functionality (press r)

(test4)
- non-playing blobs can eat and get eaten 
- game over screen, size display 
- with reflect() function, safe mode (radius decreasing), stop mode
- non-playing blobs can move, they are NonPlayer objects instead of NonPlayerBlobs
    -npcs extend the world window
    -npcs can eat each other 
    -npcs can split
    -npcs can be safe/fast
- debugger mode: Size display, World coordinates display, NPCs display
- NPC behavior
    - varying radii
    - fixed, random movement
- auto generation (toggle with npc_auto_spawn): spawn based on # of tiles and density requirement. off-window npcs despawn.
- respawn (shift+R): spawn again in the same world. reset: create a new world.
- Smarter NPC Behavior (bounce off world edges - npc_can_extend toggle)
- EXPERIMENTAL:  NPC.act() : random probability of splitting, faston/off, safeon/off, random direction change


- Circle-Line-Segment Ray-Intersection between center and each edge: Hazard.intersectsEdge()
- add course hazards
    - breaker
        - rhomboid shape but can be adjusted to any polygon
        - automatically splits() (refactored) any *blob* that touches it. Of course, center of mass is adjusted.
        - too-small or too-extra blobs are killed. careful or the player will be killed.
        - or can hide behind if small enough w/ breaker_hide_flag (EXPERIMENTAL)
    - mirror

TODO (subject to change):
- more hazards
    - mirror  
    - black hole / E&M field (test5)
    - negative foods?
    - autogenerating
- add biomes (test6)?
    - textured water, forest, lava, etc.
    - index of refraction, viscosity, food density
    - adjacent frames should try to generate as the same type

FUTURE DIRECTIONS (after turn in)
- store "world" info on disk for very large worlds (single player)
- networking for multiplayer
- 3D?

Potential Issues:
- "Spawnkilling" - respawning does not consider the locations of NPCs/hazards, albeit the probability that you spawn on top of one is quite low.
- merging is absolute unless another split is made. this can cause unwanted merging after pausing or reflecting
- Mirrors - Occasional buggy behavior on intersection, undefined behavior near edges of line segment
